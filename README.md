# sentiment-analysis

Conducted sentiment analysis for movie reviews by preprocessing the data using TF-IDF vectorization, cleaning data,tokenisation. Also used correlation matrix to determine columns with positive correlation.
â€¢ Explored and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, LightBGM and linear SVM, to compare their accuracy for sentiment prediction on movie reviews. Utilized pandas and numpy libraries for data manipulation and employed grid search to fine-tune the models and optimize their performance and achieved 82 percent accuracy.
